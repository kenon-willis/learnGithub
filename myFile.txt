Thomas, I made this on Tuesday.













Steps:

1) Make a github repository titled "learningGithub"
2) Make a folder on your desktop called "MyLearningFolder"
3) Make a text file with a slogan on it and save it as "myFile" and save it into your folder
4) Right click the folder and select "git bash here"
5) Copy your repository address from Github
6) In the command line type:
	git init                                               **this initializes a git repository in your folder
	git remote add origin pasteYourRepositoryNameHere           **this connects your repository
	git status
	
	git add .
	git status
	git commit -m "added my favorite slogan"
	GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git push origin master

then enter your github credentials

Congratulations! You just pushed your project to your github repo! Check out your repo on github now!
